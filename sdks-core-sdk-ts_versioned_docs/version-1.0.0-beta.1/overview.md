# Overview

:::caution The Core TypeScript SDK Interface is currently in beta and is expected to in a stable v1.0 release in the near short term.

Its public interface shouldn't be considered final, and we may need to release breaking changes as we push towards v1.0.
:::

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to Immutable's APIs and smart contracts to help projects build better web3 games and marketplaces.

Currently, our SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's StarkEx. In future, we'll be adding StarkNet support across our platform.

## Documentation
