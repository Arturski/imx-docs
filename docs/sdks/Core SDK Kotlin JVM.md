## Github

Find the [Immutable Core SDK in Kotlin/JVM on Github](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm).

## Installation

1. Create a [Github Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` enabled.
2. Add the GitHub package as a repository either in your `build.gradle` file or `settings.gradle` if you have one:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm"
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm")
        credentials {
            username = "<github username>"
            password = "<access token>"
        }
    }
}
```
:::info
Note: We are looking to have this accessible directly via the `mavenCentral()` repository in the future.
:::

3. Add the dependency to your app `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.immutable.sdk:imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm:$version'
}
```
4. Set the correct environment (Ropsten or Production/Mainnet)
```kt
ImmutableXSdk.setBase(ImmutableXBase.Ropsten)
```

## Usage

### Standard API Requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the Immutable X APIs.

e.g. Get a list of collections ordered by name in ascending order
```kt
val response = CollectionsApi().getCollections(
    pageSize = 20,
    orderBy = "name",
    direction = "asc"
)
```
View the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/openapi.json) for a full list of API requests available in the Core SDK.

## Workflow Functions

[Utility functions](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/tree/main/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/src/main/kotlin/com/immutable/sdk/workflows) that will chain necessary API calls to complete a process or perform a transaction:

* Register a user with ImmutableX and returns the Stark key pair
* Buy cryptocurrency via Moonpay
* Buy ERC721
* Sell ERC721
* Cancel listing
* Transfer ERC20/ERC721/ETH

### Wallet Connection

In order to use any workflow functions, you will need to pass in the connected wallet provider. This means you will need to implement your own Wallet L1 [Signer](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/src/main/kotlin/com/immutable/sdk/Signer.kt) and L2 [StarkSigner](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/src/main/kotlin/com/immutable/sdk/Signer.kt).

Once you have a `Signer` instance you can generate the user's Stark key pair and use the result to implement a `StarkSigner`.
```kt
StarkKey.generate(signer).whenComplete { keyPair, error ->
    StarkKey.sign(keyPair, "0x5369676e2074686973")
}
```

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.

The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.
