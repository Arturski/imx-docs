## Why do you need to register users?

Your application may want to enable users to carry out transactions that require the user's 'signature' (a.k.a. approval/authorization). Examples of such transactions include:
* Buying NFTs
* Creating a sell order for an NFT
* Transferring ownership of an NFT to another user

On Immutable X, these are generally transactions that deal with changes in asset ownership that require the approval of asset owners. These are transactions that update the 'state' of things on the blockchain, as opposed to just reading information.

User accounts (a.k.a. 'wallets'), are used to authorize transactions. In order for users to transact on L2, they need an L2 wallet. User registration on Immutable creates this L2 wallet for them.

## How to register users?

First, the user needs an existing L1 wallet. The reason for this is that an L2 wallet needs to be associated with an L1 wallet in order to “bridge” (move) a user’s assets between L1 and L2. 

Then:
1. The user's L1 wallet is used to generate a key that is used for the user's L2 wallet:
    1. Connect to the user's L1 wallet
    2. [Prompt the user](#) to use their L1 wallet to sign a message that generates their L2 wallet keys ([How is the key generated?](#))
2. The L1 and L2 wallet key pair is recorded either [on-chain or off-chain](#).

### Prompting a user to sign with their L1 wallet
Because a user's L1 wallet must be used to generate their L2 wallet as part of the user registration process, when building an application that enables user registration on Immutable, you must consider the UI that your users will experience.

Immutable has two options for you to obtain the signature from the user:
* Link SDK which provides an interface 

### On-chain vs off-chain registration
* **On-chain**: The L1 and L2 wallet pair is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Off-chain**: The L1 and L2 wallet pair is stored in an Immutable database. Any activity that a user performs on L2 is also recorded in Immutable databases for that L2 user account (wallet). It is only when the user requests for a transaction that requires the state of the corresponding L1 wallet to change (ie. withdrawing an NFT from the L2 wallet to the L1 wallet) that the pairing of the user's L1 and L2 wallet is recorded on-chain, on Ethereum.

### How to register users using:
* API
* Typescript SDK
* Kotlin (JVM) SDK
