A collection refers to a deployed [token smart contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens), the tokens of which can be freely transacted (ie. minted, traded, bought and sold) on Immutable X's layer 2.

Each collection belongs to a [project](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-project).

The best way to create a project is to use the [imx-examples](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#2-create-collection) repository.

#### Pre-requisites:
* [Registering as a user](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-as-user)
* [Registering a collection](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-collection)

### Steps:
1. Register a collection
2. Update a collection

## 1. Register a collection
Follow the [3. Add a collection](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#3-add-a-collection) steps in the imx-examples repository.

## 2. Update a collection
Follow the [Update collection](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/administration.md#update-collection) steps in the imx-examples repository.

#### Fields that cannot be updated:
* `contract_address`
* `metadata_api_url` - if this field is modified AFTER minting, existing assets using the previous URL will not be modified, however, the new URL will be used for new mints.

### Increase project collection limits
Collection limits can be increased by contacting [support](https://support.immutable.com/) about your project. Be sure to include your reason for an increase. Our team will respond to your request within 2 business days.
