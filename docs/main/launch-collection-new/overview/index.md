Launching a collection with Immutable X means having a [token smart contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens) deployed where tokens can be freely transacted (ie. minted, traded, bought and sold) on Immutable X's layer 2.

#### Pre-requisites:
* You must have a token smart contract deployed on L1. If you do not already have one, follow our [NFT Minting Tutorial](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs/zero-to-hero-nft-minting/).

#### Then, do the following:
1. [Register yourself as a user on Immutable X](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-as-user)
2. [Register an administrative entity, a project, on Immutable X](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-project)
3. [Register the smart contract as a collection on Immutable X](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-collection)
4. [Register collection metadata schema](/docs/launch-collection-new/register-metadata-schema)
