User registration consists of two parts:
1. Generating an Immutable X L2 user account for an Ethereum L1 account
2. Registering the L1 <-> L2 wallet pair

This enables the following:
* A user with an Ethereum L1 account now has an associated L2 account on Immutable X
* L1 users can [deposit](#) L1 assets to their L2 account
* An L2 user can transact on Immutable X (create orders, trade assets, transfer assets, etc.)
* An L2 user can [withdraw](#) their assets on L2 to their L1 account


### Off-chain, then on-chain registration
By default, Immutable's [registerUser](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference#/operations/registerUser) endpoint first registers a user **off-chain**. This means that the L1-L2 wallet pair is recorded in an Immutable database. All transactions that the user performs on L2 are recorded against this registered L2 user, however, L1 is not yet aware of the wallet mapping.

Then, when the users performs a transaction that requires an update of the state of the corresponding L1 wallet (ie. withdrawing an NFT from the L2 wallet to the L1 wallet), the user is registered **on-chain**, which means recording the L1-L2 wallet pair on Ethereum (L1).

## How to register users using the Core SDK
### 1. Initialize the Core SDK
In order to use the Core SDK, you need to [initialize it](./get-started#getting-started-with-the-core-sdk).

### 2. Generate signers
Registering a user requires the user's signature, so your application will need to create signers. See the guide on [how to generate signers](/docs/guides-new/generate-signers).

### 3. Register the user
