The following guides are to help you get started building on Immutable X using our developer tools.

They provide guidance on:
* Core SDK
* Wallet SDK
* Link SDK
* StarkNet

## Getting started with the Core SDK

Our Core SDKs make it easy for you to use Immutable X from within your application. They are a wrapper around our API and provide the bulk of the functionality of the Immutable X platform.

Before you can start using the Core SDK, you must initialize the client:
* [Typescript Core SDK](#typescript-core-sdk)
* [Kotlin (JVM) Core SDK](#kotlin-jvm-core-sdk)
* [Swift Core SDK](#swift-core-sdk)
* [Golang Core SDK](#golang-core-sdk)

#### Typescript Core SDK

Initialize the Core SDK client with the network on which you want your application to run (see [all networks available](./src/config/config.ts)):

| Param | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `Config.SANDBOX` | The default test network (currently, it is GoÃ«rli)  |
| `Config.ROPSTEN` | Ropsten test network (to be deprecated soon) |
| `Config.PRODUCTION` | Ethereum network  |

```ts
import { ImmutableX, Config } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';
const config = Config.ROPSTEN; // Or PRODUCTION or SANDBOX
const client = new ImmutableX(config);
```
