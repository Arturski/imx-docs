* [Overview](#overview)
* How to withdraw and deposit assets using:
  * [Core SDK](#deposit-and-withdraw-assets-using-the-core-sdk)
  * [Link SDK](#deposit-and-withdraw-assets-using-the-link-sdk)
  * [StarkNet](#deposit-and-withdraw-assets-on-starknet)

## Overview

The great thing about Immutable X is that you can transfer your assets between L1 and L2, depending on the layer on which you would like to transact with them. This means that you can take advantage of the cheaper transaction fees on L2 for transactions such as minting, or buying, or selling, NFTs, but you can withdraw them to L1 if you decide that you now want to sell this asset on L1 instead.

Terminology to note:
* "Bridging" - another term for transferring assets between different layers
* "Deposits" - transferring an asset from L1 to L2 (depositing to L2)
* "Withdrawal" - transferring an asset from L2 to L1 (withdrawing to L1)

### Types of assets that Immutable X supports transfer of

| Token type                                      | StarkEx | StarkNet     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| ERC-20 (fungible tokens, including ETH and IMX) | ✅      | ❌            |
| ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens)                   | ✅      | ✅            |
| ERC-1155 (non-fungible tokens)                  | ❌      | Coming soon  |         

### Examples of asset transfers...

#### ...from L1 to L2 (deposits):
* A user wants to buy an NFT on L2 with ETH, however, does not have any ETH in their L2 wallet. They transfer ETH from their L1 wallet to L2 to enable them to purchase the NFT.
* A user has NFTs on L1 that they want to sell on L2 because of the reduced fees involved on an Immutable marketplace, so they transfer the NFT from L1 to L2. 

#### ...from L2 to L1 (withdrawals):
* A user has earned ETH from selling their NFT on L2, however, they want to use this ETH on L1 so they transfer it from their L2 to L1 wallet.
* A user has purchased an NFT on an Immutable marketplace, however, now wants to sell it on an L1 marketplace, so they withdraw it from L2 to L1 in order to do so.


## Deposit and withdraw assets using the Core SDK

### 1. Initialize the Core SDK
In order to use the Core SDK, you need to [initialize it](./get-started#getting-started-with-the-core-sdk).

### 2. Obtain the user's signature
Enabling users to transfer assets requires a user's signature, so your application will need to connect to user wallets. See the guide on [how to obtain user signatures](/docs/guides-new/user-signatures).
