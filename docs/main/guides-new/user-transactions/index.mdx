## What are user transactions?

For the purposes of Immutable X, user transactions are transactions that require a user's signature. Typically, these are ones that deal with changes in asset ownership, requiring the approval of asset owners.

The main user transactions on Immutable X are:
1. [Creating orders](#1-creating-orders)
2. [Filling orders (executing trades)](#2-filling-orders-executing-trades)
2. [Transferring assets between users](#3-transferring-assets-between-users)

If the transactions are occurring on the StarkEx settlement layer, users must be [registered](/docs/wip/user-registration) before they can execute these types of transactions on Immutable X.

## 1. Creating orders

An order can be thought of as a 'listing' for the sale of an asset. When you create an order, you are listing an asset that you own for sale.

[See guides >](/docs/wip/user-transactions/create-order)

## 2. Filling orders (executing trades)
Filling an order means buying an asset that has been put up for sale. In order to do this, a trade must be created. When creating a trade, you specify, amongst other things, the order ID of an existing order.

[See guides >](/docs/wip/user-transactions/fill-order)

## 3. Transferring assets between users
An asset owner can choose to transfer the ownership of their asset to another user. Of course, this transaction requires the approval (signature) of the owner.
