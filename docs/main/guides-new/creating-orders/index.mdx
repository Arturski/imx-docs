## Overview

An order is a sale listing for an asset. It contains details like price and sale period. Some applications, such as marketplaces, may want to allow users to create orders in order to sell their assets.

### Where is the order created?
When an order is created, it is added to Immutable X's orderbook smart contract on StarkEx. This shared orderbook is what enables all orders created on Immutable X to be available on every marketplace built on this protocol.

## Create orders using the Core SDK

### 1. Initialize the Core SDK
In order to use the Core SDK, you need to [initialize it](./get-started#getting-started-with-the-core-sdk).

### 2. Obtain the user's signature
Creating an order for a user requires a user's signature, so your application will need to connect to user wallets. See the guide on [how to obtain user signatures](/docs/guides-new/user-signatures).

### 3. Set the order params
