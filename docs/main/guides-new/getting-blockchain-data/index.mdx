## What sort of blockchain data?

**NOTE**: The 'blockchain' that we are referring to here is the Immutable X L2 protocol (consisting of the StarkEx and StarkNet settlement layers). We are not trying to get data from the Ethereum blockchain (L1).

The main types of data that applications trying to retrieve from Immutable X are:

| Type of data | Description | Example use-cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| as | asd | a sd s|


* **Assets** are tokens (fungible or non-fungible) that can be owned by users
* **Orders** are listings to sell assets. They can be 'filled', which means that a 'trade' is created to another user to buy asset listed at the price requested on the order.

Other data that you can get information on include:
* **Collections**, which are groups of assets governed by the same smart contract (see [Anatomy of a non-fungible smart contract](#))
* **Trades**, orders that have been filled

## What other data can you get?

What data about assets can you get?
- Assets
- Collections
- Orders
- Historical transactions
- Showing orders from other marketplaces
What can you do with asset data?
- Show users assets and allow them to filter
- Facilitate user transactions (listing and purchasing of assets)
- Analyse transactions
How do you get data on assets, collections and orders?
How do you filter the data?
