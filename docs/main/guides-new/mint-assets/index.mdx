Minting assets on Immutable X means to bring into existence tokens from a smart contract. For more information on this concept, please see [Deep dive into minting](/docs/key-concepts-new/minting).

In order for a user to mint tokens, they need:
1. A smart contract deployed on L1 (Ethereum)
2. To be the owner of the smart contract (as returned when calling the contract's `owner()` function)
3. To be registered as a user on Immutable X
4. To have registered an administrative entity, a project, on Immutable X
5. To have registered their collection (as represented by their smart contract) on Immutable X

**Available with:**
* [Core SDK](#core-sdk)
* [JS SDK (deprecating soon)](/docs/asset-minting)
* [StarkNet](#starknet)

## Core SDK

Once you have verified that a user has a smart contract deployed on L1 and that they are the owner, then your application can start the process of enabling them to mint tokens on L2 from this contract.

### 1. Register user
Before a user can register a project or collection and mint tokens on Immutable X, they must be registered as a user on Immutable X. Follow [this guide](/docs/guides-new/user-registration) to do this.

### 2. Register a project
A project is an administrative-level entity that is associated with an user. A project can have many collections, which are represented by smart contracts.

The `createProject` endpoint requires a signer (obtained in the [previous step](#1-register-user)) and [createProjectRequest](https://docs.x.immutable.com/sdk-references/core-sdk-ts/1.0.0-beta.2/interfaces/index.createprojectrequest) object:
```ts
const createProjectRequest = {
  company_name: "company",
  contract_email: "email",
  name: "name"
}
```

Then, create a project:

### 3. Register a collection
A collection refers to a deployed [token smart contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens) that has been registered on Immutable. Once this has occured, its tokens can be transacted (ie. minted, traded, bought and sold) on Immutable X.

Each collection belongs to a project.

```ts
const createCollectionRequest = {
  name: "name",
