# Overview

:::danger WALLET SDK WEB IS UNSTABLE
Since it has not hit the version 1.0 yet, its public interface should not be considered final, and future releases may need to have breaking changes without further notice.
:::

The Immutable X Wallet SDK provides a straightforward way to connect with a range of L1 and L2 wallets to access the needed signers for the Core SDK functionalities.
