# Additional Info

### Contract Requests

Immutable X is built as a ZK-rollup in partnership with StarkWare. We chose the ZK-rollups because it is the only solution capable of scale without compromise. This means whenever you mint or trade an NFT on Immutable X, you pay zero gas, and the validity of all transactions are directly enforced by Ethereum’s security using zero-knowledge proofs -- the first “layer 2” for NFTs on Ethereum.

The Core SDK provides interfaces for all smart contracts required to interact with the Immutable X platform.

[See all smart contract available in the Core SDK](#smart-contract-autogeneration)

```go
// This example is only to demonstrate using the generated smart contract clients
// We recommend using the workflows to deposit NFT
func DepositNft(l1signer signers.L1Signer, starkKey, assetType, vaultID, tokenID *big.Int) {
   cfg := config.GetConfig(config.Sandbox, "alchemy api key")
   client, err := ethclient.Dial(cfg.EthereumClientEndpoint)
   if err != nil {
      log.Panic(err)
   }
   defer client.Close()

   ethAddress := ethcommon.HexToAddress(l1signer.GetAddress())
   auth := &bind.TransactOpts{
      From: ethAddress,
      Signer: func(address ethcommon.Address, tx *types.Transaction) (*types.Transaction, error) {
         if address != ethAddress {
            return nil, bind.ErrNotAuthorized
         }
         return l1signer.SignTx(tx)
      },
      Context: context.Background(),
   }

   core, err := contracts.NewCore(ethcommon.HexToAddress(cfg.StarkContractAddress), client)
   transaction, err := core.DepositNft(auth, starkKey, assetType, vaultID, tokenID)
   log.Println("transaction hash:", transaction.Hash())
}
```


## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.
The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.

### Smart contract autogeneration

The Immutable solidity contracts can be found under `contracts` folder. Contract bindings in golang is generated using [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings#abigen-go-binding-generator).

#### Core

The Core contract is Immutable's main interface with the Ethereum blockchain, based on [StarkEx](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4).

[View contract](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-golang/tree/main/contracts/Core.sol)

#### Registration

The Registration contract is a proxy smart contract for the Core contract that combines transactions related to onchain registration, deposits and withdrawals. When a user who is not registered onchain attempts to perform a deposit or a withdrawal, the Registration combines requests to the Core contract in order to register the user first. Users who are not registered onchain are not able to perform a deposit or withdrawal.

For example, instead of making subsequent transaction requests to the Core contract, i.e. `registerUser` and `depositNft`, a single transaction request can be made to the proxy Registration contract - `registerAndWithdrawNft`.

#### IERC721

Standard interface for interacting with ERC721 contracts, taken from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721).
