## 1000 - Something went wrong

Failed to instantiate SDK IMX Client when connecting wallet.

It is a critical issue. Nothing can be done here by an user but to contact the support team. Although this one likely would happen during the partner integration process itself.

Contact support team or Check Sdk settings (if partner integrating).

## 1001 - Something went wrong retrieving your tokens list ${apiError}

Unable to retrieve tokens list.

This one can be related to a connection failure communicating with the Api.
- Just retry the operation to redo the connection.
- If not related to connection issues, contact the support team.

Retry the operation/Refresh the page or Contact support team

## 1002 - Something went wrong when retrieving your wallet address. Check with your wallet provider

Failed to retrieve the wallet address.

- There are no more things that can be done by the user on Screen. It will be needed to fix the provider issue and then redo the operation.

Check with provider.
