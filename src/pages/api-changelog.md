# API changelog

This is the list of API versions and the changes associated with them that are released every time a breaking change is introduced.

A breaking change is one that is *not* [backwards compatible](#backwards-compatible-changes).

### Backwards-compatible changes:
* Adding new API resources.
* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
* Adding new properties to existing API responses.
* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
* Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error messages, and other human-readable strings. This includes adding or removing fixed prefixes.
